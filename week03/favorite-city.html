    <h1> My favorite city</h1>
    
    <p> My favorite city is Salvador. Salvador is the capital of Bahia and one of the oldest cities in Brazil, founded in 1549. 
        Known for its rich culture and blend of African, Indigenous, and European traditions, 
        the city is famous for the Pelourinho, Carnival, and typical cuisine such as acarajé. 
        In addition, Salvador has beautiful beaches and a strong musical identity, marked by samba and axé.
